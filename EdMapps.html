        <h2> About the Project </h2>
        <p> In the summer of 2018, I was working as a Web Development intern
          when my manager gave me a facisnating challenge. The production team
          had been using 25 different tables to store related info and wanted
          to build a system that could aggregate this data quickly and effeciently.
          In about a week, I was able to throw together a quick mock-up app
          using Django and present it to my potential customers. They
          liked it and my manager gave me the go ahead to begin development.
          In the course of a year, myself and another manager with front-end
          skills were able to build out a fully functional web application
          that dramatically improved the process. The app had a variety of
          features, including using Redis and Celery to update data from
          a sharepoint server. While the real app stores proprietary data,
          the code for the development version can be found below!
